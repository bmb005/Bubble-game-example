Bubble Game

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the circle at the bottom of the screen.  When it catches a bubble, it will grow and the bubble will be removed.

Eventually, bubbles will be different sizes, and bubbles smaller than the popper will make it grow, and bubbles larger than the popper will damage it.
